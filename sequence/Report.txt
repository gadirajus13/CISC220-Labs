A) The order would be [0,1,2,3,4] because the numbers are strictly increasing
B) The order would be [4,3,2,1,0] because the numbers are strictly decreasing
C) Initially, we take in the values of the sequence and check if the char given is 'n', '+', or a '-'.
    the first for loop checks the string and breaks into pieces and then puts it into a vector while 
    adding a number to the deque everytime it does. Then we use a second for loop to check the value at 
    a given position in the vector starting from the end and tracking back to the beginning. If the given
    char is a '-', the loop pushes the smallest value in the deque to the front of the list; if the given
    char is a '+' or 'n', the loop pushes the largest remaining value to the front of the list. Then we print
    out the solution with another for loop. The time complexity of this solution would be O(n) because we use 
    one for loop to determine the order of the values in the solution list. Since that given for loop only
    contains an if/else statement which has a time complexity of O(1), our solution would have a time complexity
    of O(n). We chose to use a deque because for our purpose we only had to pull numbers from the front or the
    end,therefore it was the most efficient data structure. Additionally, we chose to use a list because we are
    pushing all the values to the front, without needing to change each value like we would have had to do if
    we used an array.
