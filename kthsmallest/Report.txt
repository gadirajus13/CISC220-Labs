My design for this program closely follows QuickSort in its recursive calls. Primarily, I begin by creating a partition
in the array and this becomes the source for all my cases. My base case consists of checking whether the pivot element in the array
is in the same position as k or not.If the pivot is in the same position as k, that means we found the number we are looking for.
The first recursive call checks the left subarray while the second recursive call checks the right subarray. By doing this, the 
kthsmallest function is very similar to QuickSort.
